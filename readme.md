There are three python files in the repository:
- main.py: Define the main functions of the chatbot.
- emoji_map.py: Define some mappings, such as the mapping between emoji and the mood.
- dbhelper.py: Define the database operations.

The folder resources contains the database. It is not uploaded here.

Following the steps to run and use the chatbot:
1. Run the model with '''python main.py'''
2. Search for the user_id "greenapple1_bot" in the telegram.
3. Follow the instructions of "greenapple1_bot" to use and chat with the chatbot.

Notation: If main.py cannot run, it is possible that I am running main.py, so the chatbot can be used without running the script anymore.
If the chatbot does not work properly, use /cancel to remove data from database and start the conversation from the beginning.
